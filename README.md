## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

I started with the HTML layout and styled the two pages using CSS. I used Javascript functions to display the second card and the user's selected rating. 

### Built with

- HTML

- CSS

- Javascript

### What I learned

This was a great opportunity to practice Javascript. 

### Continued development

I want to keep working on incorporating Javascript functions into future projects. 

### Acknowledgments

Thanks to @mason-stewart for JS feedback!
